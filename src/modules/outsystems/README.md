## Arvisan OutSystems module
The files that can be found in this folder are mostly OutSystems-specific,
as they make assumptions on the layering of the dataset (Domain, Application, (Layer), Sublayer, Module).

To keep Arvisan somewhat universal, all these functions, components, etc are grouped in this folder.
